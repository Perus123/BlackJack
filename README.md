# Blackjack Game
Hi, I'm Paul and this is the first game I ever made.
It's blackjack made using the Pygame library.

# Features
- has the Draw and Stand functionalities.
- has drawings for cards
- drawings for Start Draw and Stand buttons made by me
- allows endless play

# There are some features which would make the game a bit more fun which I intend to add in the near future:

- Special screen for winning from either party if a blackjack has been hit at the start of the round
- A more detailed score for situations where the Ace is valued at 1 instead of 11 (Ex: 10/20)
- A animation for the dealer draw
- (not necessary) a way to log in into an account and play with a imaginary balance


# Remarks to self for future projects
- The name of the variables should be constant (pick one : x_of_y, xOfY, xofy)
- Plan way further than you already have planned !!!
